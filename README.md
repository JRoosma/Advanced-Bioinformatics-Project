Python program to be run in terminal in Unix/Linux environment in order to use Pysam / Samtools Libraries. User will be asked in the terminal window to input the file path to the BAM file, not the BAI or Sorted files as these files just need to be in the same folder as the BAM file. Program will proceed to open the BAM file, check contents, index to the Y chromosome, and read the raw sequence on the y chromosome, searching for a genetic anomaly / genetic deletion within the sequence. The program then assigns a score for the likelihood of an anomoly being present / notifies the user of the details of the location of the genetic anomaly / deletion within the sequence.
